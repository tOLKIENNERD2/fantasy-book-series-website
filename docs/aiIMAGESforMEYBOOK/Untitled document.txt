A Lore Rhyme of The Dwarves


The smooth mossberry 
And ye shall not tarry


The emerald tree’s apples
for the breath that rattles


When traveling in dire cold 
The blue blaze of the ice-wold


For weakening wounds or tiring work
The ferns that under stones do lurk


As the lake washes the shore
The water fern will restore


To ye a wondrous new vigor
When weary from the season’s rigor

The Woldgarth of the Emerald Glens


When Baer the bold was lord
Rigant of the glens, the reward
Of his folk, he kept in no hoard


But dealt in justness his gold.
One day he hunted on the wold
That lay above his hold


Through weald and fern’s fen 
He came to a darkling den. 
He found his quarry, that glen


It harbored a wolf with deeds
So black and dire. The meads
he haunted. Baer amongst the reeds


Laid him down and dreamed
Of bears a dancing where streamed 
a brook under hill that gleamed 


He built upon that hill 
A fort that stands still
Aside the running rill


As mountain stands long
So shall stand his stead






The Craftsfolk of Tal-Tormind


The folk of mountain lone
They carved scenes of yore 
On countless walls of stone.
The bird, the bear, and boar


They emblazoned pon doors. 
The smiths they worked the gold
and silver bright. The cores 
of jewels they shaped and rolled


As wind upon the stone 
The masons struck and ground.
The folk of mountain lone
with polished wood, bound 


with iron and bronze,
