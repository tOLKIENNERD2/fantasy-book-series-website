            <h2>Stream weaver</h2>
            <p><strong>Height:</strong> 4-7 feet while standing<br>
            <strong>Length:</strong> 4-7 feet while on all fours<br>
            <strong>Aggressiveness:</strong> Peaceful except to mudbeast<br>
            <strong>Age:</strong> Up to 80 years</p>
            <p>This peculiar animal looks like a squirrel except that it is aquatic. It has large teeth and will cut small trees to weave into dams, hence their name. They are mortal foes of the mudbeast and have complex canals and streams which they control with surprising regularity. They live in groups of about eight, usually family.</p>

            <h2>Mudbeast</h2>
            <p><strong>Height:</strong> 2-3 feet<br>
            <strong>Length:</strong> 4-5 feet<br>
            <strong>Aggressiveness:</strong> extreme<br>
            <strong>Age:</strong> up to 20 years</p>
            <p>This animal is thin and long and makes large mud lodges underwater. The lodges are plastered frequently with mud, resulting in a protective coating. Since they share territory and their behaviour is similar, mudbeasts and stream weavers are often in mortal combat. They live in groups of around twenty.</p>
